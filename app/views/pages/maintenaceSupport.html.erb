					<h4>One of the challenges facing many IT organizations today is lack of internal resources. Obtaining skilled IT personnel is becoming harder but remains a necessity for supporting our ever changing business environment. Trident's Staff Augmentation services can help you achieve your business goals by providing skilled personnel with an average of over 25 years experience to work under your direction. This allows organizations to dynamically adjust their staff resources when needed to provide support for projects requiring specialized skills that do not currently exist internally.</h4>
